# vim-switcher

vim-switcher aims to be a simple plugin that you configure to get commands that will quickly get you from one filetype to another.

Let's say you are working on an *angular* project, you surely switch between filetypes of the same name but with different extentions a lot.
For example, you want to switch from `app.component.html` to `app.component.ts`. Depending on how you use vim, you may want to simply change buffer.
With this plugin you would be able to do: `:OpenTs` or `Ots` from your `.html` buffer and it would open the corresponding `.ts` file.
